### Objective

[Microverse](https://www.microverse.org) is an online software development school. Students learn multiple programming languages and Computer Science fundamentals, through working on real projects with other students to reach mastery. Every day, each student, her/his coding partner, and the stand-up team will support and hold each other accountable to produce great work while remote pair programming.

There is a dashboard where the students can connect and get info for their weekly progress and the daily program. On the dashboard, there is an option called 'View Progress'. By clicking on it, the students see a page with options to choose between Projects, Coding Challenges, and Professional skills.

When students click on an option they see a list of their projects. The problem is that after a couple of months the list has many completed projects and they have to scroll a lot. This is especially true in the case of Coding Challenges. This extension solves this problem by removing temporarily the completed projects.
